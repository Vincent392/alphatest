			<div class="recruitment">23/08/2010: You all can't behave yourselves. The guidelines clearly state: "You may not distribute the provided software, incl. server software [...]".</div><div class="recruitment">This rule alone had over 50 violations in the day of release alone when we started the multiplayer test. Because of this, we made the decision to remove the download links to the server softeware along with the manual jar downloads. If you were kicked out of the game with the error message "Session unauthorized", this was the cause.</div><div class="recruitment">To those playing fair: thank you.</div>
			<br>
			<div class="recruitment">20/08/2010: The recruitment process works by selecting accounts automatically. Please do NOT email us asking to let someone in, or to ask how the recruitment is carried out. These emails will be ignored.</div>
